/**
 * Returns a lazy Set view of the key contained in this map. A LazySet is optimized for querying speed
 * (preventing eager deserialization and hashing on HashSet insertion) and does NOT provide all operations.
 * Any kind of mutating function will throw an UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION. Same is true for operations
 * like java.util.Set#contains(Object) and java.util.Set#containsAll(java.util.Collection) which would result in
 * very poor performance if called repeatedly (for example, in a loop). If the use case is different from querying
 * the data, please copy the resulting set into a new java.util.HashSet.
